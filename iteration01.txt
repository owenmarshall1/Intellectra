Iteration 1 Retrospective

What went well?
	During this iteration, our team significantly improved in terms of planning, communication, and collaboration.
    We were able to effectively coordinate tasks, streamline our workflow, and maintain clear communication
    throughout the development process. This resulted in better alignment on project goals, more efficient
    problem-solving, and a smoother overall experience working together. Our ability to delegate tasks
    appropriately and provide timely updates contributed to the successful implementation of key features.

What can be improved?
	One area for improvement is the overall aesthetic and user experience of the GUI. While our current design is
    functional, we believe it could be refined to achieve a more modern look. Improving layout consistency and 
    incorporating a cleaner, more polished design would contribute to a better user experience. Going forward,
    we will focus on refining the interface to ensure that it is not only visually appealing but also user-friendly
    and professional.

What are some challenges? How do we address them?
	A major challenge we faced was our initial decision to develop the front-end in Java and the back-end in Python,
    which created integration difficulties due to our lack of experience in merging the two languages. To address
    this, we switched the front-end to Python, eliminating compatibility issues and streamlining development. This
    adjustment helped us recover lost time and ensured a smoother workflow.
